# Generator

In this project, i created a  small system that generates noisy data that should fit a
certain shape. 
The generator will receive several desired shapes from a config file and generate two
types of points: inlier points and outlier points

To be continued: Estimate the original shape from the data, and tests the estimation against
the shape.
